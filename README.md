## General info
In this assignment from CodeCademy i was tasked to change the main.js file accoring to the assignments to do list.
It involved generating a random number from 1 to 10 for the target number, then i had to ensure that the "computer's" guess would also be a random number from 1 to 10.
When i finished that i had to ensure the user could pick a number from 1 to 10 and whichever gues was closest to the the target number would win, i also had to add a round feature aswell as a score feature to the project, both of which had to be updated according to the number of rounds played and number of time a round was won, either by the user or "computer".
